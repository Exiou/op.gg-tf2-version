# og.gg TF2 - Logs Analytics

This project was developed with the intent of showing a compiled log data, based on the user previous logs, based on
class, gamemode and time.

Yes, sometimes we don't perform very well in-game, but this project will help you show your average performance, instead
of showing you only the performance of a specific game.

# Usage

```shell script
yarn
yarn start
```
